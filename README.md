# Koto Landing Page Clone
This is a project where I recreated the Studio Koto website. I wanted to turn it into a high-quality portfolio landing page that shows off what I can do with animations and clean code. In summary, this project serves as a showcase of modern front-end engineering, focusing on fluid animations, responsiveness, and an amazing UI.

This isn't just a clone, I took the original Studio Koto design and refurbished it to work as a high-quality portfolio. I built it as a single-page application (SPA) to show how I can turn a professional design into a fast, smooth, and fully working website.
