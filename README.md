# Koto Landing Page Clone
This is a project where I recreated the Studio Koto website. I wanted to turn it into a high-quality portfolio landing page that shows off what I can do with animations and clean code. In summary, this project serves as a showcase of modern front-end engineering, focusing on fluid animations, responsiveness, and an amazing UI.

I built it as a single-page application (SPA) to show how I can turn a professional design into a fast, smooth, and fully working website.

## Technologies
- `React + Vite`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Framer Motion`
- `React Router`
- `Swiper.js`
- `Netlify`

## Key Features
- **Interactive Hero Interactions** - I built a "hover-to-reveal" system where hovering over specific underlined text triggers a beautiful display of category-specific images and videos.

- **Custom Page Transitions** - Moving between sections feels connected and smooth rather than jumping abruptly.

- **Interactive Custom Cursor** - A unique cursor that changes its look based on what you are hovering over (like "Read" or "View" modes).

- **Immersive Page Loader** - A custom entrance animation that ensures a great first impression when the site loads.

- **Smooth Scrolling Feed** - Motion-heavy effects that feel natural and organic as the user explores the content feed.
